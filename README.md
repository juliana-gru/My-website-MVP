# Welcome to my personal website

This website is a placeholder for my portfolio website, which is under development.

Here are some of my projects on github:

### #1 Jamming:
Web app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

Built with React. I originally used class components but then refactored to use function components and hooks.
